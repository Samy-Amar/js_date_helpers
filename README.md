***- What is this?***

An implementation of the cool date/time methods you'll find in Rails, but for Javascript

***- Why?***

Why not?

***- Do you use it at Skello?***

As of January 2017, no.

***- Should I use it?***

If you want to.

***- But you're overriding the Number and Date prototypes, isn't that terrible?***

It's not *conventional* in JS, but it won't break your code.
